The genome assembly was manually adjusted in the desktop version of Juicebox.  Finished files were uploaded to the (new) directory 05_manual_adjustment_in_JBAT. Two rounds of manual editing were done, so the post-assembly-3D-DNA step was technically run twice, once after each round of edits.  But the process was identical, so only one script is being included in 06_3D_DNA_post_adjustment.sh.  For more information, please see the Genome Assembly Cookbook (https://aidenlab.org/assembly/manual_180322.pdf) and the Aiden Lab "Tutorial video for Juicebox Assembly Tools" on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj7RhQZHM18).
